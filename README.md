SuperCycler displays IFF images with palette animations on AGA Amigas.
Author: Kalms / TBL, mikael@kalms.org

This program displays IFF images with color cycling. Up to 16 ranges are supported.
The image should ideally be in one of the native Amiga resolutions, like 320x256, and max 256 colors.
The default tick rate is 50Hz (which is what DPaint does, but PC graphics programs probably use 60Hz).

Viewer controls:
  1-9 controls color cycling delay (1 = normal DPaint speed)
  Space pauses/restarts color cycling
  R reloads the image from disk
  B toggles between linear blending, or hard stepping of colors
  Esc or LMB exits viewer
